Video-feedback fractal hobby code. Most things slightly broken. Some things beautiful.

This is loosely descended from a feedback project in Java, termed "Perceptron", that began circa 2005. Since then, several implementations of video feedback have emerged elsewhere. This project contains more recent attempts to "reboot" the video-feedback rendering techniques, or to demonstrate it in other languages.

### Video feedback fractals

The video feedback rendering approach is efficient: it involves scanning over an image "display" buffer and pulling in geometrically-transformed pixels from a separate "camera" buffer, to simulate a camera pointed at a screen displaying the camera's own feed (typically with some additional geometric or color-space effects added). Small adjustements in the geometric transformations and color filters can lead to striking and beautiful effects, and it is the hope that the examples collected in this project may spur further creativity and community interest in the technique.
