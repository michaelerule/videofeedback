* PERCEPTRON SETTINGS FILE
*
* Perceptron reads this file on startup to determine the values of
* key program parameters. You may alter these settings at will, some
* values may cause the program to run out of memory or behave
* unexpectedly. Try to follow the guidelines for each setting.
* Follow the format <variable name> + " " + <value>

* RESOURCE DIRECTORY
*
* The contents of the resource directory are best left untouched,
* because the program cannot start if a file is missing.

image_directory resource/images/

* THE AUDIO INPUT can turn Perceptron into a sound visualizer (testing!)

audio_line 0

* SCREEN SETTINGS
*
* This determines the resolution of Perceptron's screen. Perceptron 
* attempts to set the display size to the smallest possible display
* that supports the resolution listed here. If the screen width and
* height listed here are greater than the maximum resolution of the 
* monitor, then these values default to the maximum monitor resolution.
* Set these to smaller values to increase speed at runtime. 
* possible values : integers greater than 0

*TREE SETTINGS
*
* These settings control aspects of the Tree located in the foreground
* This is the largest depth to which to render the tree that is in
* the foreground. Reduce this if the program runs out of memory 
* (which may manifest as the program failing to run at all)
* The number of computations required to draw the tree scales as
* 2^(1 + tree_depth) so the time for rendering the tree grows rapidly 
* as a function of depth.
* possible values : integers greater than 0 and less than 30

max_tree_depth 10

* This is the minimum depth to which to render the tree.
* possible values : integers greater than 0 and less than 30

min_tree_depth 4

* EQUATION DEFINITIONS (maps)
*
*   expressions in terms of z, no spaces please
*
*   Legal constants include:
*   e = 2.71828...
*   i = square-root of -1
*   p = pi = 3.14159...
*   f = golden ratio = 1.618...
*
*   There is a lon-standing bug in the parser with respect to unary minus
*   applied to expressions. So things like -cos(x) might not work. I think
*   the workaround for now is to use underscore _, so say _cost(x) instead. 
*   or write as 0-cos(x). 1000 points if you can fix this bug (:
