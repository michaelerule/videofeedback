Perceptron is a fast fractal feedback renderer written in Java.
<p>
Perceptron uses simulated video feedback to rapidly render fractals in 
real time. Perceptron uses no platform specific language, and so can run on
any operating system supporting the Java runtime. 
<p>
This is very much a work in progress. I use it for parties and concerts, as
well as genertaing fractal imagry for use in web design. I hope to clean it
up, such that other people can use it.
<p>
Discrepancies in Java runtime implementations can cause unexpectedly poor
performance on some systems. The most notable example is that this code-base
ran quicky on my MacBook for about a year, until a java runtime update changed
somethign in the 2D drawing library, slowing it down dramatically
